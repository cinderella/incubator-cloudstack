<chapter id="chap-Runbook-Config">
  <title>Configuration</title>
  <para>
    As we noted before we will be using security groups to provide isolation
    and by default that implies that we'll be using a flat layer-2 network. 
    It also means that the simplicity of our setup means that we can use the 
    quick installer. 
  </para>
  <section id="sect-Runbook-Config-UI_Access">
    <title>UI Access</title>
      <para>
        To get access to CloudStack's web interface, merely point your 
        browser to http://<replaceable>172.16.10.</replaceable>2:8080/client
        The default username is 'admin', and the default password is 'password'.
        You should see a splash screen that allows you to choose several options
        for setting up CloudStack. You should choose the 
        <option>Continue with Basic Setup</option> option. 
      </para>
      <para>
        You should now see a prompt requiring you to change the password for
        the admin user. Please do so.

  <section id="sect-Runbook-Config-Zone">
    <title>Setting up a Zone</title>
    <para>
      A zone is the largest organization entity in CloudStack - and we'll be creating one, this 
      should be the screen that you see in front of you now. And for us there are 5 pieces of
      information that we need.
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Name - we will set this to the ever-descriptive 'Zone1' for our cloud.</para>

      <title>Notes about DNS settings</title>
      <para>
        CloudStack distinguishes between internal and public DNS. Internal 
        DNS is assumed to be capable of resolving internal-only 
        hostnames, such as your NFS serverâ€™s DNS name. Public DNS is 
        provided to the guest VMs to resolve public IP addresses. You can 
        enter the same DNS server for both types, but if you do so, you 
        must make sure that both internal and public IP addresses can 
        route to the DNS server. In our specific case we will not use any
        names for resources internally, and we have indeed them set to look
        to the same external resource so as to not add a namerserver setup
        to our list of requirements.
