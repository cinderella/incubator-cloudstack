		<programlisting>
		# mysql -p
		mysql> use cloud;
		mysql> select id from host where type = 'SecondaryStorage';
		mysql> update host_details set value = 'nfs://192.168.160.20/export/mike-ss1'
  		where host_id = HOSTID and name = 'orig.url';
		mysql> update host set name = 'nfs://192.168.160.20/export/mike-ss1' where type
  		= 'SecondaryStorage' and id = #;
		mysql> update host set url = 'nfs://192.168.160.20/export/mike-ss1' where type
 		 = 'SecondaryStorage' and id = #;
		mysql> update host set guid = 'nfs://192.168.160.20/export/mike-ss1' where type
  		= 'SecondaryStorage' and id = #;
