    <title>Example LDAP Configuration Commands</title>
    <para>To understand the examples in this section, you need to know the basic concepts behind calling the &PRODUCT; API, which are explained in the Developerâ€™s Guide.</para>
    <para>The following shows an example invocation of ldapConfig with an ApacheDS LDAP server</para>
    <programlisting>http://127.0.0.1:8080/client/api?command=ldapConfig&amp;hostname=127.0.0.1&amp;searchbase=ou%3Dtesting%2Co%3Dproject&amp;queryfilter=%28%26%28uid%3D%25u%29%29&amp;binddn=cn%3DJohn+Singh%2Cou%3Dtesting%2Co%project&amp;bindpass=secret&amp;port=10389&amp;ssl=true&amp;truststore=C%3A%2Fcompany%2Finfo%2Ftrusted.ks&amp;truststorepass=secret&amp;response=json&amp;apiKey=YourAPIKey&amp;signature=YourSignatureHash</programlisting>   
    <para>The command must be URL-encoded. Here is the same example without the URL encoding:</para>
    <programlisting>http://127.0.0.1:8080/client/api?command=ldapConfig
&amp;hostname=127.0.0.1
&amp;searchbase=ou=testing,o=project
&amp;queryfilter=(&amp;(%uid=%u))
&amp;binddn=cn=John+Singh,ou=testing,o=project
&amp;bindpass=secret
&amp;port=10389
&amp;ssl=true
&amp;truststore=C:/company/info/trusted.ks
&amp;truststorepass=secret
&amp;response=json
&amp;apiKey=YourAPIKey&amp;signature=YourSignatureHash
    </programlisting>
    <para>The following shows a similar command for Active Directory. Here, the search base is the testing group within a company, and the users are matched up based on email address.</para>
<programlisting>http://10.147.29.101:8080/client/api?command=ldapConfig&amp;hostname=10.147.28.250&amp;searchbase=OU%3Dtesting%2CDC%3Dcompany&amp;queryfilter=%28%26%28mail%3D%25e%29%29 &amp;binddn=CN%3DAdministrator%2COU%3Dtesting%2CDC%3Dcompany&amp;bindpass=1111_aaaa&amp;port=389&amp;response=json&amp;apiKey=YourAPIKey&amp;signature=YourSignatureHash</programlisting>    
    <para>The next few sections explain some of the concepts you will need to know when filling out the ldapConfig parameters. </para>
