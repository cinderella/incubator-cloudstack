	<title>Changing the Root Password</title>
    <para>During installation and ongoing cloud administration, you will need to log in to the UI as the root administrator.
        The root administrator account manages the &PRODUCT; deployment, including physical infrastructure.
        The root administrator can modify configuration settings to change basic functionality, create or delete user accounts, and take many actions that should be performed only by an authorized person.
        When first installing &PRODUCT;, be sure to change the default password to a new, unique value.</para>
