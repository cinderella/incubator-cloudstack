	<title>Creating a New Volume</title>
	<para>You can add more data disk volumes to a guest VM at any time, up to the limits of your storage capacity. Both &PRODUCT; administrators and users can add volumes to VM instances. When you create a new volume, it is stored as an entity in &PRODUCT;, but the actual storage resources are not allocated on the physical storage device until you attach the volume. This optimization allows the &PRODUCT; to provision the volume nearest to the guest that will use it when the first attachment is made.</para>
