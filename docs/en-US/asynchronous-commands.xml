		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>They are identified in the API Reference by an (A).</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>They will immediately return a job ID to refer to the job that will be responsible in processing the command.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>If executed as a "create" resource command, it will return the resource ID as well as the job ID.</para>
				<para>You can periodically check the status of the job by making a simple API call to the command, queryAsyncJobResult and passing in the job ID.</para>
