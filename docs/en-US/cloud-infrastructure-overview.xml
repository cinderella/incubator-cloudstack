	<title>Cloud Infrastructure Overview</title>
	<para>
		The Management Server manages one or more zones (typically, datacenters) containing host computers where guest virtual machines will run. The cloud infrastructure is organized as follows:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Zone: Typically, a zone is equivalent to a single datacenter. A zone consists of one or more pods and secondary storage.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Pod: A pod is usually one rack of hardware that includes a layer-2 switch and one or more clusters.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Cluster: A cluster consists of one or more hosts and primary storage.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Host: A single compute node within a cluster. The hosts are where the actual cloud services run in the form of guest virtual machines.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Primary storage is associated with a cluster, and it stores the disk volumes for all the VMs running on hosts in that cluster.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Secondary storage is associated with a zone, and it stores templates, ISO images, and disk volume snapshots.</para></listitem>
