	<title>Adding Password Management to Your Templates</title>
	<para>&PRODUCT; provides an optional password reset feature that allows users to set a temporary admin or root password as well as reset the existing admin or root password from the &PRODUCT; UI.</para>
	<para>To enable the Reset Password feature, you will need to download an additional script to patch your template. When you later upload the template into &PRODUCT;, you can specify whether reset admin/root password feature should be enabled for this template.</para>
	<para>The password management feature works always resets the account password on instance boot.  The script does an HTTP call to the virtual router to retrieve the account password that should be set.  As long as the virtual router is accessible the guest will have access to the account password that should be used.   When the user requests a password reset the management server generates and sends a new password to the virtual router for the account.  Thus an instance reboot is necessary to effect any password changes.</para>
	<para>If the script is unable to contact the virtual router during instance boot it will not set the password but boot will continue normally.</para>
