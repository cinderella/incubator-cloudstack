	<title>Automatic Snapshot Creation and Retention</title>
	<para>(Supported for the following hypervisors: <emphasis role="bold">XenServer</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">VMware vSphere</emphasis>, and <emphasis role="bold">KVM</emphasis>)</para>
	<para>Users can set up a recurring snapshot policy to automatically create multiple snapshots of a disk at regular intervals. Snapshots can be created on an hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly interval. One snapshot policy can be set up per disk volume. For example, a user can set up a daily snapshot at 02:30.</para>
	<para>With each snapshot schedule, users can also specify the number of scheduled snapshots to be retained. Older snapshots that exceed the retention limit are automatically deleted. This user-defined limit must be equal to or lower than the global limit set by the &PRODUCT; administrator. See  <xref linkend="globally-configured-limits"/>. The limit applies only to those snapshots that are taken as part of an automatic recurring snapshot policy. Additional manual snapshots can be created and retained.</para>
