===========================================================

NOTE - This folder is a work in progress.  The project has not determined
how to best establish a nightly DevCloud build process, or how to distribute
the image.

This folder contains various scripts used to build the devcloud image.
devcloudsetup.sh - the origional devcloud build script (assumes an Ubuntu 12.04 VM image)

build_vagrant_basebox.sh - a script that uses VirtualBox, VeeWee, Vagrant (patched) and puppet to create a devcloud basebox
veewee - configuration files used to build a basic Ubuntu 12.04 vagrant box via VeeWee
basebuild - The Vagrantfile and puppet module that gets applied to the basic Ubuntu 12.04 box
devcloudbox - The Vagrantfile and puppet module that is used with the [hopefully] distributed devcloud base box
